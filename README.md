- Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible fixed asset over its useful life. It reflects how much of the asset’s value has been used up over time.
- Why depreciation matters: shows asset’s decreasing value on financial statements.Helps in tax deduction (as expense). Aids in budgeting for replacement of assets.
- Examples of depreciable assets: machines,vehicles,buildings,computers.

## 📌 Project Overview
- A Python project to perform sales forecasting using SES method.
   Metode SES:
Ft+1=α⋅At+(1−α)⋅FtF_{t+1} = \alpha \cdot A_t + (1 - \alpha) \cdot F_tFt+1=α⋅At+(1−α)⋅Ft 
Misal:
•	α = 0.3
•	A₁₆ = 170
•	F₁₆ ≈ hasil SES model fitting → gunakan nilai output dari Python
